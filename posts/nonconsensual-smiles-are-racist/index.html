        <p>Keep your smiles to yourself, bigot.</p>

<p>If there&rsquo;s one thing we learned from the Covington incident, it&rsquo;s that people of privilege <em>still</em> don&rsquo;t understand the boundaries of interracial smile dynamics.</p>

<p>Let me put it plainly: smiling at a minority who does not want to be smiled at is a hate crime.  Here&rsquo;s why.</p>

<p><img src="/img/covington.jpg" alt="Covington" /></p>

<p>You may remember the news from last month, when a young white male from <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/covington-high-school-students-cleared-of-any-wrongdoing-in-viral-incident-after-independent-investigation" target="_blank"> Covington High School</a> somehow decided it was appropriate to smile at an elderly Native American man.</p>

<p>The old man had entered the younger man&rsquo;s personal space, beating a drum close to his face in an apparent protest of the young boy&rsquo;s Make America Great Again hat.  Instead of breaking down in tears and apologizing to the older man for his troubling hat, a symbol even more offensive in 2019 than even the swastika, the young boy had the nerve to simply smile in return.</p>

<p>Conservatives are arguing that the boy did nothing wrong, because their little orange brains are still stuck in a bygone era where smiling wasn&rsquo;t a disgustingly racist gesture.</p>

<h1 id="here-s-why-smiling-is-problematic">Here&rsquo;s why smiling is problematic:</h1>

<h2 id="showing-your-teeth-is-a-sign-of-aggression">Showing your teeth is a sign of aggression</h2>

<p>If you&rsquo;re smiling at someone, you&rsquo;re saying this to them:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m an aggressor, and I&rsquo;m ready to pounce on you as my prey.  And I&rsquo;m going to use all of my privilege to do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Check your privilege, and check your smile, shitlord.</p>

<p>No, seriously, check your smile: you have a crumb stuck between your teeth.</p>

<h2 id="smiling-is-an-invasion-of-body-language-space">Smiling is an invasion of body language space</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s a microaggression to subject someone else to your body language.</p>

<p>The only acceptable way to greet someone is with a neutral face, completely void of emotion.</p>

<p>This way, you don&rsquo;t accidentally project pleasant moods onto the other person which could be interpreted as a hate crime.</p>

<h2 id="smiling-has-a-long-history-in-maga-country-as-a-secret-signal-to-broadcast-trump-support">Smiling has a long history in MAGA Country as a secret signal to broadcast Trump support</h2>

<p>When you see two white men smiling at each other, or even nodding in passing, they are indicating their support for Trump to each other.</p>

<p>The correct emotion during this time of fascist rule is sorrow.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s necessary to drudge through your daily existence in grief to ensure others are fully aware that you&rsquo;re bothered by Trump and are committed to #resisting.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re not unhappy <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub> about Trump&rsquo;s presidency, and allowing it to occupy your waking thoughts and ruin your life, you&rsquo;re part of the problem.  Being happy while Trump is in office is NOT okay.</p>

    <h2 class="card-title">Scientist discovers new 49th gender</h2>
    <p class="card-text"><p>The gender, known as &ldquo;hermachodite&rdquo;, carries the recognizable trait of a micropenis 2.5 inches in length and 3.5 inches in girth, with testicles that look like labia.</p>

<p>The appropriate pronoun to use for members of this gender is &ldquo;zhuh.&rdquo;  Calling someone of the hermachodite gender &ldquo;he&rdquo; or &ldquo;she&rdquo;, or even &ldquo;they&rdquo; or &ldquo;zher&rdquo;, constitutes a hate crime.</p>
