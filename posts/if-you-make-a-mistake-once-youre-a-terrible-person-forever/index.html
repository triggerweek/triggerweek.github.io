        <p>Liam Neeson recently recounted a story about a dark period in his life many years ago where he, after learning that a close friend had been raped by a black man, took to the streets with a weapon in hopes a man of that same race would provoke him into unleashing his rage.</p>

<p>No violent altercation ended up taking place, and Liam regrets the incident deeply.  He volunteered the story as evidence of the evil all men can do if we&rsquo;re not careful to keep our emotions in check, and how we can all grow from the recognition of our past mistakes.</p>

<p>But this is 2019, and luckily we have the social media mob to reassure us that nobody can ever change, and that Liam is, in fact, still a neofascist white supremacist because of some racist thoughts he had 30-odd years ago.  Thanks, social media mob!</p>

<p>Mobs of activists on Twitter are calling for Hollywood to blacklist Neeson from appearing in any more movies.</p>

<p>What Liam Neeson doesn&rsquo;t realize is that good people never make mistakes.  That&rsquo;s right: if you&rsquo;ve ever made a mistake, you are simply not a virtuous person, no matter what you&rsquo;ve done for the good of mankind since then.</p>

<p>Oh?  You starred in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schindler%27s_List" target="_blank">one of the most powerful anti-racist, anti-fascist films of all time</a>?</p>

<p>Big deal, that means nothing if you&rsquo;ve never tweeted about how virtuous a person you are.  The real fight for social progress comes in the form of #Resist tweets.  Get with the times, old man.</p>

<p>All you had to do was fashion yourself a shank, join your local Antifa chapter, and try to stab anyone who votes Republican.</p>
