        <p>On the battlefields of social justice, we seek to put an end to bullying.</p>

<p>And the only way to do that is to take to social media and bully everyone who disagrees with us.</p>

<p><img src="/img/knight.jpg" alt="Knight" /></p>

<h1 id="take-jokes-personally-especially-the-ones-made-ages-ago">Take jokes personally - especially the ones made ages ago</h1>

<p>Comedians make jokes.</p>

<p>But all of their jokes need to be run by you first.</p>

<p>If a comedian makes a joke you find offensive, the best option isn&rsquo;t to ignore it and move on with your life with the realization that sometimes people are going to say things that make you uncomfortable.</p>

<p>No, the correct response is to campaign against them on social media until their <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/gilbert-goffried-fired-afl-2011-3" target="_blank">sponsors drop them</a> or their <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/06/arts/kevin-hart-homophobic-tweets.html">hosting gigs are canceled</a>.</p>

<p>Be careful not to give a joke a free pass even if the comedian is &ldquo;on your side&rdquo; politically.  Even jokes that have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/07/opinion/columbia-nimesh-patel-comedian-kicked-offstage.html" target="_blank">progressive-leaning messages behind them are unacceptable if they mention race or sexuality at all</a>.  Reminding people that multiple races and sexual preferences exist can be highly triggering, somehow.  And our goal is to ensure that nobody ever feels even <em>slightly</em> uncomfortable, so we need to preemptively censor these jokes before anyone <em>does</em> get offended.</p>

<p>Remember, you&rsquo;re making the world a &ldquo;better place&rdquo; by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbxCNYP24B4" target="_blank">removing all comedy</a> that could be taken offensively.</p>

<h1 id="when-they-apologize-to-you-double-down-on-the-bullying">When they apologize to you, double down on the bullying</h1>

<p>A heartfelt apology isn&rsquo;t cause to put the brakes on the bullying train.  What are you, a decent human being?  No, get out there and pile onto the apology tweet with even more.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an example of how it&rsquo;s done.  Take Norm Macdonald&rsquo;s apology tweet, written shortly after the Twitter mob went after him.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Roseanne and Louis have both been very good friends of mine for many years. They both made terrible mistakes and I would never defend their actions. If my words sounded like I was minimizing the pain that their victims feel to this day, I am deeply sorry.</p>&mdash; Norm Macdonald (@normmacdonald) <a href="https://twitter.com/normmacdonald/status/1039661638629187585?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 11, 2018</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


<p>Now, look at the most-starred comments on that tweet:</p>

            <h4>That&#39;s how it&#39;s done.  Bonus points for using the word &#34;mansplain&#34; unironically.</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>So there you have it.  Take all your anger out by bullying some public figure on social media.  Trust me, you&rsquo;ll feel better about your miserable life.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re making the world a &ldquo;better place.&rdquo;  Right?  Right?</p>

<p>Right.</p>

    <p class="card-text"><p>Sometimes, people will express opinions with which you don&rsquo;t agree.</p>

<p>The proper response is, of course, to bother them until they stop expressing those opinions.  If possible, maybe throw out an accusation of some form of bigotry, or put them on blast on social media.</p>

<p>But when that doesn&rsquo;t work, how do you cope with being exposed to ideas that don&rsquo;t fit into your narrowly-defined worldview?</p>
